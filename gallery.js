	//DEFINE YOUR VARIABLES
	//select all the slides (value of the variable will be an array)

	//set the index slide (number that starts on 0)

	//set current slide based on index


	//STEPS
	//1. stack slides together OR hide all slides except for the one we want to see. (e.g., all but the first)
		//a.
		//b.
	//2. move in the specified direction
		//a.
		//b.
		//c. return to the opposite or resetting after you click thru each image and reach the end of the slideshow

	//INSTRUCTIONS
	//hide all the slides

	//show the first slide

	//when the user clicks "next"

		//hide the current slide


		//show the next
	slideIndex++; // 
		//same as slideIndex=
		//slideindex+1
		
		//conditional check of the slideIndex (if greater than 6 bc there are 7 photos in the slideshow..or whatever is the last one)

		//reset to 0 (there are 7 photos, but 0 is the first number so it's technically "return after 6")
		//go to the start

	//when the user clicks "previous"

		slideIndex--; // 
		//same as slideIndex=
		//slideindex-1
		
		//conditional check of the slideIndex (if greater than 6 bc there are 7 photos in the slideshow..or whatever is the last one)

		//reset to 6 (there are 7 photos, but 0 is the first number so it's technically "return after 6")
		//go to the start


		//go to the end
